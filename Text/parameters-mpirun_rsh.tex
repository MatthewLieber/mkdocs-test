\section{MPIRUN\_RSH Parameters}
\label{def:mpirun_rsh-parameters}

\subsection{MV2\_COMM\_WORLD\_LOCAL\_RANK}
\label{def:mv2_comm_world_local_rank}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Class: Run time
	\item Applicable Interface(s): All
\end{itemize}
The local rank of a process on a node within its job. 
The local rank ranges from 0,1 ... N-1 on a node with N processes running on it.

\subsection{MV2\_COMM\_WORLD\_LOCAL\_SIZE}
\label{def:mv2_comm_world_local_size}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Class: Run time
	\item Applicable Interface(s): All
\end{itemize}
The number of ranks from this job that are running on this node.

\subsection{MV2\_COMM\_WORLD\_RANK}
\label{def:mv2_comm_world_rank}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Class: Run time
	\item Applicable Interface(s): All
\end{itemize}
The MPI rank of this process in current MPI job

\subsection{MV2\_COMM\_WORLD\_SIZE}
\label{def:mv2_comm_world_size}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Class: Run time
	\item Applicable Interface(s): All
\end{itemize}
The number of processes in this MPI job's MPI\_Comm\_World.

\subsection{MV2\_FASTSSH\_THRESHOLD}
\label{def:mv2_fastssh_threshold}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Class: Run time
    \item Default: 800
	\item Applicable Interface(s): All
\end{itemize}
Number of nodes beyond which to use hierarchical ssh during start up. This
parameter is only relevant for mpirun\_rsh based start up. Note that unlike most
other parameters described in this section, this is an environment variable that
has to be set in the run time environment (for e.g. through export in the bash
shell). 

\subsection{MV2\_NPROCS\_THRESHOLD}
\label{def:mv2_nprocs_threshold}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Class: Run time
    \item Default: 8192
	\item Applicable Interface(s): All
\end{itemize}
Number of processes beyond which to use file-based communication scheme in the hierarchical ssh during start up. This
parameter is only relevant for mpirun\_rsh based start up.

\subsection{MV2\_MPIRUN\_TIMEOUT}
\label{def:mpirun-timeout}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Class: Run time
    \item Default: Dynamic - based on number of nodes
\end{itemize}
The number of seconds after which mpirun\_rsh aborts job launch. Note that unlike most other parameters described in this section, this is an environment variable that has to be set in the run time environment (for e.g. through export in the bash shell).

\subsection{MV2\_MT\_DEGREE}
\label{def:mt-degree}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Class: Run time
    \item Default: 32
\end{itemize}
The degree of the hierarchical tree used by mpirun\_rsh. Note that unlike most other parameters described in this section, this is an environment variable that has to be set in the run time environment (for e.g. through export in the bash shell).

\subsection{MPIEXEC\_TIMEOUT}
\label{def:mpiexec-timeout}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Class: Run time
    \item Default: Unset
    \item Unit: Seconds
\end{itemize}
Set this to limit, in seconds, of the execution time of the mpi application.
This overwrites the \\ MV2\_MPIRUN\_TIMEOUT parameter.

\subsection{MV2\_DEBUG\_FORK\_VERBOSE}
\label{def:mpiexec-timeout}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Class: Run time
    \item Type: Null or positive integer
    \item Default: 0 (disabled)
\end{itemize}

Set the verbosity level of the debug output for the process management operations (fork, waitpid, kill, ...) of mpirun\_rsh and mpispawn processes. The value 0 disables any debug output, a value of 1 enables a basic debug output, and a value of 2 enables a more verbose debug output.

Note: All debug output is disabled when MVAPICH2 is configured with the \texttt{--enable-fast=ndebug} option.
