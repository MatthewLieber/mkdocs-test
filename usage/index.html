<h1 id="basic-usage-instructions">Basic Usage Instructions</h1>
<h2 id="compile-applications">Compile Applications</h2>
<p>MVAPICH2 provides a variety of MPI compilers to support applications
written in different programming languages. Please use
<code>mpicc, mpif77, mpiCC</code>, or <code>mpif90</code> to compile applications. The correct
compiler should be selected depending upon the programming language of
your MPI application.</p>
<p>These compilers are available in the <code>MVAPICH2_HOME/bin</code> directory.
MVAPICH2 installation directory can also be specified by modifying
<code>$PREFIX</code>, then all the above compilers will also be present in the
<code>$PREFIX/bin</code> directory.</p>
<h2 id="run-applications">Run Applications</h2>
<p>This section provides instructions on how to run applications with
MVAPICH2. Please note that on new multi-core architectures,
process-to-core placement has an impact on performance. Please refer to
Section <a href="#running-with-efficient-cpu-core-mapping">2.5</a> to learn about running MVAPICH2
library on multi-core nodes.</p>
<h3 id="run-using-mpirun_rsh">Run using <code>mpirun_rsh</code></h3>
<p><em>The MVAPICH team suggests users using this mode of job start-up for all
interfaces (including OFA-IB-CH3, OFA-IB-Nemesis, OFA-iWARP-CH3,
OFA-RoCE-CH3, TrueScale (PSM-CH3), Omni-Path (PSM2-CH3), Shared
memory-CH3, TCP/IP-CH3 and TCP/IP-Nemesis) This <code>mpirun_rsh</code> scheme
provides fast and scalable job start-up. It scales to multi-thousand
node clusters.</em></p>
<p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Either <code>ssh</code> or <code>rsh</code> should be enabled between the front nodes and
    the computing nodes. In addition to this setup, you should be able
    to login to the remote nodes without any password prompts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Alternatively, if the SLRUM resource manager is in use, <code>mpirun_rsh</code>
    can use the <code>–launcher srun</code> option to use SLRUM daemons to launch.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All host names should resolve to the same IP address on all
    machines. For instance, if a machine's host names resolves to
    127.0.0.1 due to the default /etc/hosts on some Linux distributions
    it leads to incorrect behavior of the library.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="examples-of-running-programs-using-mpirun_rsh">Examples of running programs using <code>mpirun_rsh</code>:</h4>
<p>This command launches <code>cpi</code> on nodes n0 and n1, two processes per node.
By default <code>ssh</code> is used.</p>
<p>This command launches <code>cpi</code> on nodes n0 and n1, two processes per each
node using <code>rsh</code> instead of <code>ssh</code>.</p>
<p>This command launches <code>cpi</code> on nodes n0 and n1, two processes per each
node using <code>srun</code> instead of <code>ssh</code>. This is usefull on clusters that do
not support direct ssh access to compute nodes.</p>
<h4 id="mpirun_rsh-hostfile">MPIRUN_RSH Hostfile:</h4>
<p>A list of target nodes may be provided in the file <code>hosts</code> one per line.
MPI ranks are assigned in order of the hosts listed in the hosts file or
in the order they are passed to mpirun_rsh. i.e., if the nodes are
listed as n0 n1 n0 n1, then n0 will have two processes, rank 0 and rank
2; whereas n1 will have rank 1 and 3. This rank distribution is known as
"cyclic\". If the nodes are listed as n0 n0 n1 n1, then n0 will have
ranks 0 and 1; whereas n1 will have ranks 2 and 3. This rank
distribution is known as "block\". A cyclic (one entry per host)
hostfile can be modified with the <code>ppn</code> launch option to use a block
distribution.</p>
<h4 id="hostfile-format">Hostfile Format</h4>
<p>The mpirun_rsh hostfile format allows for users to specify hostnames,
one per line, optionally with a multiplier, and HCA specification.</p>
<p>The multiplier allows you to save typing by allowing you to specify
blocked distribution of MPI ranks using one line per hostname. The HCA
specification allows you to force an MPI rank to use a particular HCA.</p>
<p>The optional components are delimited by a ':'. Comments and empty lines
are also allowed. Comments start with '#' and continue to the next
newline.</p>
<h4 id="sample-hostfile">Sample hostfile</h4>
<pre><code>$ cat hosts
# sample hostfile for mpirun_rsh
host1           # rank 0 will be placed on host1
host2:2         # rank 1 and 2 will be placed on host 2
host3:hca1      # rank 3 will be on host3 and will use hca1
host4:4:hca2    # ranks 4 through 7 will be on host4 and use hca2

# if the number of processes specified for this job is greater than 8
# then the additional ranks will be assigned to the hosts in a cyclic
# fashion.  For example, rank 8 will be on host1 and ranks 9 and 10 will
# be on host2.
</code></pre>
<p>When launching in a SLURM or PBS environment the hostfile can be read
directly from the resource manager. In this case, a combination of the
<code>np</code> and <code>ppn</code> launch options are sufficient. The <code>ppn</code> value of 1 will
result in a cyclic distribution, while higher <code>ppn</code> values will provide
a block distribution. Note that the number of processes specified by
<code>np</code> will always be met, the <code>ppn</code> value will just specify the number of
processes to assign to each host consecutively.</p>
<p>This command launches <code>cpi</code> on all nodes allocated to the SLRUM/PBS job
assigning rank 0 and rank 1 on n1, rank 2 and rank 3 on n2, and so on.
If those are the only nodes in the job n1 will then recieve rank 3 and
4, n2 will recieve rank 5 and 6, etc.</p>
<h4 id="specifying-environmental-variables">Specifying Environmental Variables</h4>
<p>Many parameters of the MPI library can be configured at run-time using
environmental variables. In order to pass any environment variable to
the application, simply put the variable names and values just before
the executable name, like in the following example:</p>
<p>Note that the environmental variables should be put immediately before
the executable.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you may also place environmental variables in your shell
environment (e.g. <code>.bashrc</code>). These will be automatically picked up when
the application starts executing.</p>
<p>Note that mpirun_rsh is sensitive to the ordering of the command-line
arguments.</p>
<p>There are many different parameters which could be used to improve the
performance of applications depending upon their requirements from the
MPI library. For a discussion on how to identify such parameters, see
Section <a href="/scalable/#on-demand-connection-management-tuning">performance-tuning</a>.</p>
<h4 id="job-launch-using-mpmd">Job Launch using MPMD</h4>
<p>The mpirun_rsh framework also supports job launching using MPMD mode. It
permits the use of heterogeneous jobs using multiple executables and
command line arguments. The following format needs to be used:</p>
<p>A list of different group of executables must be provided to the job
launcher in the file <code>configfile</code>, one per line. The <code>configfile</code> can
contain comments. Lines beginning with "#\" are considered comments.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p>A list of target nodes must be provided in the file <code>hosts</code> one per line
and the allocation policy previously described is used.</p>
<p>Please note that this section only gives general information on how to
run applications using mpirun_rsh. Please refer to the following
sections for more information on how to run the application over various
interfaces such as iWARP and RoCE.</p>
<h4 id="other-options">Other Options</h4>
<p>Other options of <code>mpirun_rsh</code> can be obtained using</p>
<h3 id="run-using-hydra-mpiexec">Run using <code>Hydra (mpiexec)</code></h3>
<p>Hydra is the default process manager for MPICH. MVAPICH2 also
distributes Hydra along with with mpirun_rsh. Hydra can be used either
by using <code>mpiexec</code> or <code>mpiexec.hydra</code>. All interfaces of MVAPICH2 will
work using Hydra. The following is an example of running a program using
it:</p>
<p>The Hydra process manager can be used to launch MPMD jobs. For example
the following command:</p>
<p>The environment variable FOO=1 passed to "-genv" is applied the
environment to all executables (i.e. exec1 and exec2). The values BAR=1
applies to exec1 and BAR=2 applies to only exec2.</p>
<p>This process manager has many features. Please refer to the following
web page for more details.</p>

<p>SLURM is an open-source resource manager designed by Lawrence Livermore
National Laboratory and maintained by SchedMD. SLURM software package
and its related documents can be downloaded
from: <a href="http://www.schedmd.com/">http://www.schedmd.com/</a></p>
<p>Once SLURM is installed and the daemons are started, applications
compiled with MVAPICH2 can be launched by SLURM, e.g.</p>
<p>The use of SLURM enables many good features such as explicit CPU and
memory binding. For example, if you have two processes and want to bind
the first process to CPU 0 and Memory 0, and the second process to CPU 4
and Memory 1, then it can be achieved by:</p>
<p>To use PMI-2 with SLURM, please use:</p>
<p>To use PMIx with SLURM, please use:</p>
<p>If PMI-2/PMIx is selected and the installed version of SLURM supports
PMI/PMIx, MVAPICH2 will automatically use the extensions.</p>

<h3 id="run-on-pbstorque-clusters">Run on PBS/Torque Clusters</h3>
<p>Both mpirun_rsh and mpiexec can take information from the PBS/Torque
environment to launch jobs (i.e. launch on nodes found in PBS_NODEFILE).</p>
<p>You can also use MVAPICH2 in a tightly integrated manner with PBS. To do
this you can install mvapich2 by adding the --with-pbs option to
mvapich2. Below is a snippet from ./configure --help of the hydra
process manager (mpiexec) that you will use with PBS/Torque.</p>
<p>--with-pbs=PATH specify path where pbs include directory and lib

<h3 id="run-with-dynamic-process-management-support">Run with Dynamic Process Management support</h3>
<p>MVAPICH2 (OFA-IB-CH3 interface) provides MPI-2 dynamic process
management. This feature allows MPI applications to spawn new MPI
processes according to MPI-2 semantics. The following commands provide
an example of how to run your application.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>To run your application using mpirun_rsh\
    \
    Note: It is necessary to provide the hostfile when running dynamic
    process management applications using mpirun_rsh.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To run your application using mpiexec (Hydra)\</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Please refer to Section
<a href="/parameters/#mv2_support_dpm">support-dpm</a> for information about the MV2_SUPPORT_DPM
environment variable.</p>
<h3 id="run-with-mpirun_rsh-using-ofa-iwarp-interface">Run with mpirun_rsh using OFA-iWARP Interface</h3>
<p>The MVAPICH2 library can automatically detect iWARP cards and use them
with the appropriate settings at run time. This feature deprecates the
use of the environment variable <code>MV2_USE_IWARP_MODE</code> which was being
used earlier to enable the use of iWARP devices at run time.</p>
<p>All the systems to be used need the following one time setup for
enabling RDMA CM usage.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Setup the RDMA CM interface:</strong> RDMA CM interface needs to be
    setup, configured with an IP address and connected to the network.\</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Setup the Local Address File:</strong> Create the file (<code>/etc/mv2.conf</code>)
    with the local IP address to be used by RDMA CM. (Multiple IP
    addresses can be listed (one per line) for multi-rail
    configurations).\</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Programs can be executed as follows:</p>
<p>The iWARP interface also provides TotalView debugging and shared library
support. Please refer to
Section <a href="/usage/#run-using-totalview-debugger-support">config-gen2</a>.</p>
<h3 id="run-with-mpirun_rsh-using-ofa-roce-interface">Run with mpirun_rsh using OFA-RoCE Interface</h3>
<p>RDMA over Converged Ethernet (RoCE) is supported with the use of the run
time environment variable <code>MV2_USE_RoCE</code>.</p>
<p>Programs can be executed as follows:</p>
<p>RoCE requires loss-less Ethernet fabric. This requires to configure
Ethernet switch to treat RoCE traffic as loss-less. A separate VLAN
interface needs to be created on RoCE NIC on all compute nodes and
assign a private IP address</p>
<p>In loss-less fabric setup, MVAPICH2 can be run in RoCE mode in following
two ways</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Put private VLAN IP addresses in <code>/etc/mv2.conf</code> and run in RDMA CM
    mode\
    \</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All VLAN interfaces will appear as additional GID indexes (starting
    from 1) on the InfiniBand HCA side of the RoCE adapter. User can
    select non-default GID index using run-time parameter\
    MV2_DEFAULT_GID_INDEX(<a href="/parameters/#mv2_default_gid_index">mv2-gid-index</a>) and RoCE priority service level
    using MV2_DEFAULT_SERVICE_LEVEL.\
    \</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="run-using-ipoib-with-mpirun_rsh-or-mpiexec">Run using IPoIB with mpirun_rsh or mpiexec</h3>
<p>You would like to run an MPI job using IPoIB but your IB card is not the
default interface for IP traffic. Assume that you have a cluster setup
as the following:</p>
<pre><code>    ----------- ------------- ------------- --
    #hostname    Eth Addr     IPoIB Addr   
    compute1    192.168.0.1   192.168.1.1  
    compute2    192.168.0.2   192.168.1.2  
    compute3    192.168.0.3   192.168.1.3  
    compute4    192.168.0.4   192.168.1.4  
    ----------- ------------- ------------- --
</code></pre>
<p>The Ethernet addresses are assigned to eth0 and the IPoIB addresses are
assigned to the ib0 interface. The host names resolve to the
192.168.0.* addresses.</p>
<p>The most direct way to use the IPoIB network is to populate your hosts
file with the IP addresses of the ib0 interfaces.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>Another way to achieve this is to use the <em>-iface</em> option of hydra. This
allows you to have your hosts file to use the host names even though
they resolve to the eth0 interface.</p>
<p>Example:</p>

<h2 id="export-environment">Export Environment</h2>
<p>Traditionally with mpirun_rsh you have to specify all environment
variables that you want visible to the remote MPI processes on the
command line. With the --export option of mpirun_rsh this is no longer
necessary.</p>
<h3 id="sample-use">Sample Use</h3>
<h4 id="traditional-method">Traditional Method</h4>
<pre><code>$ mpirun_rsh -n 2 compute1 compute2 FOO=1 BAR=baz ./osu_latency

<h4 id="with-export-option">With export option</h4>
<pre><code>$ export FOO=1 BAR=baz
$ mpirun_rsh -export -n 2 compute1 compute2 ./osu_latency
</code></pre>
<p>Please note that the -export option does not overwrite variables that
are normally already set when you first ssh into the remote node. If you
want to export all variables including the ones that are already set you
can use the -export-all option.</p>
<h4 id="with-export-all-option">With export-all option</h4>
<pre><code>$ export PATH=$PATH:/some/special/path
$ mpirun_rsh -export-all -n 2 compute1 compute2 ./osu_latency
</code></pre>
<h2 id="configuration-file-processing">Configuration File Processing</h2>
<p>MVAPICH2 supports the use of configuration values to ease the burden of
users when they would like to set and repeatedly use many different
environment variables. These can be stored in a configuration file with
statements of the form "VARIABLE = VALUE". Full line comments are
supported and begin with the "#" character.</p>
<p>The system configuration file can be placed at /etc/mvapich2.conf while
user configuration files are located at "<code>~/.mvapich2.conf</code>" by default.
The user configuration file can be specified at runtime by
MV2_USER_CONFIG if the user would like to have mvapich2 read from a
different location.</p>
<p>The processing of these files can be disabled by the use of the
MV2_IGNORE_SYSTEM_CONFIG and MV2_IGNORE_USER_CONFIG.</p>
<h3 id="sample-use_1">Sample Use</h3>
<h4 id="run-with-blocking-mode-enabled">Run with blocking mode enabled</h4>

</code></pre>
<h2 id="suspendresume-support">Suspend/Resume Support</h2>
<p>MVAPICH2 can be suspended and resumed when using a process launcher that
catches and forwards the appropriate signals.</p>
<p>For example, when using mpirun_rsh you can type Ctrl-Z (or send the
SIGTSTP signal) at the terminal and the job will suspend. You can then
later send the SIGCONT signal to the job and it will continue.</p>
<h2 id="running-with-efficient-cpu-core-mapping">Running with Efficient CPU (Core) Mapping</h2>
<p>MVAPICH2-CH3 interfaces support architecture specific CPU mapping
through the <a href="http://www.open-mpi.org/projects/hwloc">Portable Hardware Locality
(hwloc)</a> software package. By
default, the HWLOC sources are compiled and built while the MVAPICH2
library is being installed. Users can choose the "--disable-hwloc"
parameter while configuring the library if they do not wish to have the
HWLOC library installed. However, in such cases, the MVAPICH2 library
will not be able to perform any affinity related operations.</p>
<p>There are two major schemes as indicated below. To take advantage of any
of these schemes, the jobs need to run with CPU affinity
(MV2_ENABLE_AFFINITY) and shared memory\
(MV2_USE_SHARED_MEM) turned on (default). If users choose to set these
run-time parameters to 0, then the kernel takes care of mapping
processes to cores and none of these schemes will be enabled.</p>
<p>To report the process mapping, users can set the environment variable
MV2_SHOW_CPU_BINDING to 1 (Section
 <a href="/parameters-general/#mv2_show_cpu_binding">show-cpu-binding</a>).</p>
<h3 id="using-hwloc-for-cpu-mapping">Using HWLOC for CPU Mapping</h3>
<p>Under this scheme, the HWLOC tool will be used at job-launch time to
detect the processor's micro-architecture, and then generate a suitable
cpu mapping string based. Three policies are currently implemented:
"bunch", "scatter", and "hybrid". By default, we choose to use the
"hybrid" mapping. However, we also allow users to choose a binding
policy through the run-time variable, MV2_CPU_BINDING_POLICY. (Section
<a href="/parameters-general/?#mv2_show_cpu_binding">mv2-cpu-binding-policy</a>)</p>
<p>For example, if you want to run 4 processes per node and utilize "bunch"
policy on each node, you can specify:</p>
<p>The CPU binding will be set as shown in
Figure <a href="#fig:bunch">1</a>.</p>
<p><img alt="Process placement with &quot;bunch&quot; CPU binding
policy" src="../Img/nehalem-bunch.png" /></p>
<p>If you want to run 4 processes per node and utilize "scatter" policy on
each node, you can specify:</p>
<p>The CPU binding will be set as shown in
Figure <a href="#fig:scatter">2</a>.</p>
<p><img alt="Process placement with &quot;Scatter&quot; CPU binding
policy" src="../Img/nehalem-scatter.png" /></p>
<p>If two applications with four processes each need to share a given node
(with eight cores) at the same time with "bunch" policy, you can
specify:</p>
<p>The CPU binding will be set as shown in
Figure <a href="#fig:bunch2">3</a>.</p>
<p><img alt="Process placement with two applications using the &quot;bunch&quot; CPU binding
policy" src="../Img/nehalem-bunch2.png" /></p>
<p>If two applications with four processes each need to share a given node
(with eight cores) at the same time with "scatter" policy, you can
specify:</p>
<p>The CPU binding will be set as shown in
Figure <a href="#fig:scatter2">4</a>{reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:scatter2"}.</p>
<p><img alt="Process placement with two applications using the &quot;scatter&quot; CPU
binding policy" src="../Img/nehalem-scatter2.png" /></p>
<p>The aforementioned binding is based on the core level, meaning each MPI
process will be bound to a specific core. Actually, we provide different
process binding level. There are three binding levels: "core", "socket",
and "numanode" (which is designed for some multicore processor with NUMA
node unit). We use the "core" as the default binding level, and we also
allow users to choose a binding level through the run-time variable,
MV2_CPU_BINDING_LEVEL. (Section
<a href="/parameters/#mv2_cpu_binding_level">mv2-cpu-binding-level</a>) For example, if you want to run
4 processes per node and utilize "socket" as the binding level on each
node, you can specify:</p>
<p>The CPU binding will be set as shown in
Figure <a href="#fig:socket_bunch">5</a>{reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:socket_bunch"}. Note: because we use "bunch" as the
default binding policy, all four processes will be bound to the first
socket and each of them can use all four cores in this socket. When the
binding policy is "bunch" and the binding level is "socket", processes
will be bound to the same socket until the process number is larger than
the core number in the socket.</p>

<p>If you want to run 4 processes per node, utilize "socket" as the binding
level and "scatter" as the binding policy, you can specify:</p>

<h3 id="mapping-policies-for-hybrid-mpithreads-applications">Mapping Policies for Hybrid (MPI+Threads) Applications</h3>
<p>We have introduced one additional policy called "hybrid\" for
MV2_CPU_BINDING_POLICY variable. This policy can also be used for hybrid
MPI+Threads (OpenMP, pthreads, etc.) applications where each MPI rank
additionally spawns multiple threads. The detailed usage of this
variable and any additional variables you might need is discussed in
Section <a href="/usage/#optimizations-specific-to-intel-knights-landing-knl-processors">2.20</a>.</p>
<p>In addition to MV2_CPU_BINDING_POLICY, we have also provided a new
environment variable called MV2_HYBRID_BINDING_POLICY to specify thread
specific binding policies. The detailed description and usage of this
variable is explained in
Section <a href="/usage/#hybrid-and-thread-specific-binding-policies-for-mpi-and-mpithreads-applications">2.21</a>.</p>
<h3 id="user-defined-cpu-mapping">User defined CPU Mapping</h3>
<p>Under the second scheme, users can also use their own mapping to bind
processes to CPU's on modern multi-core systems. The feature is
especially useful on multi-core systems, where performance may be
different if processes are mapped to different cores. The mapping can be
specified by setting the environment variable <code>MV2_CPU_MAPPING</code> (Section
 <a href="/parameters/#mv2_cpu_mapping">mv2-cpu-mapping</a>).</p>
<p>For example, if you want to run 4 processes per node and utilize cores
0, 1, 4, 5 on each node, you can specify:</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>In this way, process 0 on each node will be mapped to core 0, process 1
will be mapped to core 1, process 2 will be mapped to core 4, and
process 3 will be mapped to core 5. For each process, the mapping is
separated by a single ":\".</p>
<p>MVAPICH2 supports binding one process to multiple cores in the same node
with ",\" or "-\". For example:</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>In this way, process 0 on each node will be mapped to core 0, core 2,
core 3, and core 4; process 1 will be mapped to core 1, process 2 will
be mapped to core 5, and process 3 will be mapped to core 6. This
feature is designed to support the case that one rank process will spawn
multiple threads and set thread binding in the program.</p>
<h3 id="performance-impact-of-cpu-mapping">Performance Impact of CPU Mapping</h3>
<p>Here we provide a table with latency performance of 0 byte and 8KB
messages using different CPU mapping schemes. The results show how
process binding can affect the benchmark performance. We strongly
suggest the consideration of best CPU mapping on multi-core platforms
when carrying out benchmarking and performance evaluation with MVAPICH2.</p>
<p>The following measurements were taken on the machine with the dual
quad-core 2.53GHz Intel Xeon processors with 12MB L3 shared cache (among
cores in one socket). MVAPICH2-was built with gcc-4.4.6 and default

<h2 id="running-with-limic2">Running with LiMIC2</h2>
<p>MVAPICH2 CH3-based interfaces support LiMIC2 for intra-node
communication for medium and large messages to get higher performance.
LiMIC2 is also used to optimize intra-node one-sided communication in
OFA-IB-CH3 and OFA-iWARP-CH3 interfaces. It is disabled by default
because it depends on the LiMIC2 package to be previously installed. As
a convenience we have distributed the latest LiMIC2 package (as of this
release) with our sources.</p>
<p>To install this package, please take the following steps.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Navigate to the LiMIC2 to source\</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Configure and build the source\</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Install\</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Before using LiMIC2 you'll need to load the kernel module. If you
followed the instructions above you can do this using the following
command (LSB init script).</p>
<ul>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p>Please note that supplying '<code>–sysconfdir=/etc</code>' in the configure line
above told the package to install the init script and an udev rule in
the standard location for system packages. Supplying '<code>–prefix=/usr</code>'
will also install the headers and libraries in the system path. These
are optional but recommended.</p>
<p>Now you can use LiMIC2 with MVAPICH2 by simply supplying the
'<code>–with-limic2</code>' option when configuring MVAPICH2. You can run your
applications as normal and LiMIC2 will be used by default. To disable it
at run time, use the env variable:</p>

<h2 id="running-collectives-with-hardware-based-multicast-support">Running Collectives with Hardware based Multicast support</h2>
<p>In MVAPICH2, support for multicast based collectives has been enabled
for MPI applications running over OFA-IB-CH3 interface. Currently, this

<li>
<p>MPI_Bcast</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>MPI_Allreduce</p>
</li>
<li>

</ul>
<p>This feature is enabled by default. This can be toggled at runtime by
using parameter\
MV2_USE_MCAST
(section <a href="/parameters/#mv2_use_mcast">use-mcast</a>). This feature is effective when the MPI job
is running on more than the threshold\
MV2_MCAST_NUM_NODES_THRESHOLD
(section <a href="/parameters/#mv2_mcast_num_nodes_threshold">mcast-num-nodes-thrshold</a>) number of nodes.</p>
<p>Both RDMA_CM and libibumad based multicast group setup schemes are

<h2 id="running-mpi_gather-collective-with-intra-node-zero-copy-designs-using-limic2">Running MPI_Gather collective with intra-node Zero-Copy designs (using LiMIC2)</h2>
<p>In MVAPICH2, we offer new intra-node Zero-Copy designs (using LiMIC2)
for the MPI_Gather collective operation based on the LiMIC2 feature.
This feature can be used, when the library has been configured to use
LiMIC2( <a href="/usage/#running-with-limic2">2.6</a>). This feature is disabled by default and
can be turned on at runtime by using the parameter MV2_USE_LIMIC_GATHER
( <a href="/parameters/#mv2_use_limic_gather">use-limic-gather</a>).</p>
<h2 id="running-with-scalable-ud-transport">Running with scalable UD transport</h2>
<p>MVAPICH2 has scalable design with InfiniBand connection less transport
Unreliable Datagram (UD). Applications can use UD only transport by
simply configuring MVAPICH2 with the '--enable-hybrid' (which is enabled
by default) and setting the environment variable MV2_USE_ONLY_UD
( <a href="/parameters/#mv2_use_only_ud">use-only-ud</a>). In this mode, library does not use any
reliable RC connections. This feature eliminates all the overheads
associated with RC connections and reduces the memory footprint at large
scale.</p>
<h2 id="running-with-integrated-hybrid-ud-rcxrc-design">Running with Integrated Hybrid UD-RC/XRC design</h2>
<p>MVAPICH2 has integrated hybrid transport support for OFA-IB-CH3. This
provides the capability to use Unreliable Datagram (UD), Reliable
Connection (RC) and eXtended Reliable Connection (XRC) transports of
InfiniBand. This hybrid transport design is targeted at emerging
clusters with multi-thousand core clusters to deliver best possible
performance and scalability with constant memory footprint.</p>
<p>Applications can use Hybrid transport by simply configuring MVAPICH2
with the '--enable-hybrid' option. In this configuration, MVAPICH2
seamlessly uses UD and RC/XRC connections by default. The use of UD
transport can be disabled at run time by setting the environment
variable
MV2_USE_UD_HYBRID( <a href="/parameters/#mv2_use_ud_hybrid">use-ud-hybrid</a>) to Zero.</p>
<p>MV2_HYBRID_ENABLE_THRESHOLD
( <a href="/parameters/#mv2_hybrid_enable_threshold">ud-hybrid-threshold</a>) defines the threshold for enabling
the hybrid transport. Hybrid mode will be used when the size of the job
is greater than or equal to the threshold. Otherwise, it uses default
RC/XRC connections.</p>
<p>For a full list of Hybrid environment variables, please refer
Section <a href="/paramaters/">mvapich-parameters</a>.</p>
<h2 id="running-with-multiple-rail-configurations">Running with Multiple-Rail Configurations</h2>
<p>MVAPICH2 has integrated multi-rail support for OFA-IB-CH3 and
OFA-iWARP-CH3 interfaces. Run-time variables are used to specify the
control parameters of the multi-rail support; number of adapters with
MV2_NUM_HCAS
(section <a href="/parameters/#mv2_num_hcas">num-hcas</a>), number of ports per adapter with
MV2_NUM_PORTS
(section <a href="/parameters/#mv2_num_ports">num-ports</a>), and number of queue pairs per port with
MV2_NUM_QP_PER_PORT
(section <a href="/parameters/#mv2_num_qp_per_port">num-qp-per-port</a>). Those variables are default to 1 if
you do not specify them.</p>
<p>Large messages are striped across all HCAs. The threshold for striping
is set according to the following formula:\
(MV2_VBUF_TOTAL_SIZE $\times$ MV2_NUM_PORTS $\times$ MV2_NUM_QP_PER_PORT
$\times$ MV2_NUM_HCAS). In addition, there is another parameter
MV2_STRIPING_THRESHOLD
(section <a href="/parameters-nem/#mv2_striping_threshold">viadev-striping-threshold</a>) which users can utilize to
set the striping threshold directly.</p>
<p>MVAPICH2 also gives the flexibility to balance short message traffic
over multiple HCAs in a multi-rail configuration. The run-time variable
MV2_SM_SCHEDULING can be used to choose between the various load
balancing options available. It can be set to USE_FIRST (Default) or
ROUND_ROBIN. In the USE_FIRST scheme, the HCA in slot 0 is always used
to transmit the short messages. If ROUND_ROBIN is chosen, messages are
sent across all HCAs alternately.</p>
<p>In the following example, we can use multi-rail support with two
adapters, using one port per adapter and one queue pair per port:\
\
Using the Hydra process manager, the same can be accomplished by:\
\
\
Note that the default values of <code>MV2_NUM_PORTS</code> and
<code>MV2_NUM_QP_PER_PORT</code> are 1, so they can be omitted.</p>
<p>\
Using the Hydra process launcher, the following command can be used:\</p>
<p>The user can also select the particular network card(s) that should be
used by using the MV2_IBA_HCA environment variable specified in
section <a href="/parameters-nem/#mv2_iba_hca">rdma-iba-hcas</a>. The following is an example of how to
run MVAPICH2 in this mode. (In the example "mlx4_0" is the name of the
InfiniBand card as displayed by the output of the "ibstat" command).</p>
<p>\
If there are multiple HCAs in the system, the user can also selectively
use some or all of these HCAs for network operations by using the
MV2_IBA_HCA environment variable. Different HCAs are delimited by colons
":". An example is shown below. In the example "mlx4_0" and "mlx4_1" are
the names of the InfiniBand card as displayed by the output of the
"ibstat" command. There can be other HCAs in the system as well.</p>
<p>\</p>
<h2 id="enhanced-design-for-multiple-rail-configurations">Enhanced design for Multiple-Rail Configurations</h2>
<p>MVAPICH2 now features an enhanced design for multiple rail
configurations for OFA-IB-CH3 and OFA-iWARP-CH3 interfaces. It can
broadly be explained by the figure given below. In addition to the
earlier design where the rails were shared among processes at run time
(as depicted under the Rail Sharing banner in the figure below),
MVAPICH2 now features a new RAIL BINDING policy which will dedicate a
particular rail to a particular process.</p>
<p><img alt="Multi-rail Scheduling
policies" src="../Img/multi-rail-design.png" /></p>
<p>The scheduling policies are broadly classified into 2 basic types. Rail
Binding and Rail Sharing.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The Rail Sharing policy has been kept the same as in earlier
    versions and can be set using the MV2_RAIL_SHARING_POLICY
    (section <a href="/parameters/#mv2_rail_sharing_policy">rail-sharing-policy</a>) (previously MV2_SM_SCHEDULING)
    parameter. It can take the values USE_FIRST or ROUND_ROBIN. However
    as opposed to the earlier versions, the number of HCAs of the same
    type on a system get detected automatically and used. The user can
    still make use of the MV2_NUM_HCAS parameter and set the number to a
    custom number of rails if required. If this parameter is not set the
    maximum number gets used.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the Rail Binding policy only that HCAs is made available to the
    process which has been assigned to it using some scheme. The default
    policy used is 'Rail Binding in a round-robin manner': If the
    parameter MV2_RAIL_SHARING_POLICY is not specified, MVAPICH2 assigns
    HCAs to the processes in a round-robin manner. The Rail Binding
    policy can either be default as described above or user defined. For
    the user defined mode the following parameter
    MV2_RAIL_SHARING_POLICY=FIXED_MAPPING should be set.</p>
<p>The user defined policies can be set in the following manner by
giving appropriate values to the parameter
MV2_PROCESS_TO_RAIL_MAPPING
(section <a href="/parameters/#mv2_process_to_rail_mapping">process-to-rail-mapping</a>)</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>MV2_PROCESS_TO_RAIL_MAPPING=BUNCH : The HCAs are assigned in a
    block manner. e.g. For 4 rails and 16 processes the mapping will
    be -- 0:0:0:0:1:1:1:1:2:2:2:2:3:3:3:3</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>MV2_PROCESS_TO_RAIL_MAPPING=SCATTER : The HCAs are assigned in a
    cyclic manner. e.g. For 4 rails and 16 processes the mapping
    will be -- 0:1:2:3:0:1:2:3:0:1:2:3:0:1:2:3</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The third option is a custom list which can be passed as a
    string to\
    MV2_PROCESS_TO_RAIL_MAPPING separated by a colon(:) as shown
    above.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>In addition to these parameters the other ENVS that can be set are
    MV2_VBUF_TOTAL_SIZE,\
    MV2_NUM_QP_PER_PORT, MV2_RAIL_SHARING_LARGE_MSG_THRESHOLD\
    (previously MV2_STRIPING_THRESHOLD), MV2_IBA_HCA. Please refer to
    the usage described for these parameters as well as the ones
    described above in (section 
    <a href="/paramaters/">mvapich-parameters</a>).</p>

<h2 id="running-with-fault-tolerance-support">Running with Fault-Tolerance Support</h2>
<h3 id="system-level-checkpointrestart">System-Level Checkpoint/Restart</h3>
<p>MVAPICH2 provides system-level rollback-recovery capability based on a
coordinated Checkpoint-Restart protocol involving all the application
processes.</p>
<p>The following section
( <a href="#basic-checkpointrestart-scheme">2.15.1.1</a>) provides instructions for basic
checkpoint/restart operations with MVAPICH2. These require the Berkeley
Lab Checkpoint/Restart (BLCR) library in order perform checkpoints of
local processes. Then, advanced features are presented.
Section <a href="#write-aggregation-based-fast-checkpointing-scheme">2.15.1.2</a> details the usage of the
fast-checkpointing scheme based on aggregation.
Section <a href="#fault-tolerance-backplane-ftb-support">2.15.1.3</a> present the support of the new standardized
Fault Tolerance Backplane (FTB).</p>
<h4 id="basic-checkpointrestart-scheme">Basic Checkpoint/Restart Scheme:</h4>
<p>BLCR is a library that allows to take checkpoint of individual
processes. Its usage is mandatory to take advantage of the
checkpoint/restart functionality in MVAPICH2. Here are the steps that
allows the usage of BLCR with MVAPICH2.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Download and install the BLCR (Berkeley Lab's Checkpoint/Restart)
    package. The packages can be downloaded from <a href="http://crd.lbl.gov/groups-depts/ftg/projects/current-projects/BLCR/berkeley-lab-checkpoint-restart-for-linux-blcr-downloads/">this web
    page</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make sure the BLCR packages are installed on every node and the
    <code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code> must contain the path to the shared library of
    BLCR, usually <code>$BLCR_HOME/lib</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>MVAPICH2 needs to be compiled with checkpoint/restart support, see
    section <a href="/install/#configuring-a-build-for-ofa-ib-ch3ofa-iwarp-ch3ofa-roce-ch3">config-gen2</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>BLCR kernel modules must be loaded on all the compute nodes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make sure the PATH contains the path to the executables of BLCR,
    usually <code>$BLCR_HOME/bin</code>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Users are strongly encouraged to read the <a href="http://upc-bugs.lbl.gov/blcr/doc/html/BLCR_Admin_Guide.html">Administrators
guide</a> of
BLCR, and test the BLCR on the target platform, before using the
checkpointing feature of MVAPICH2.</p>
<p><strong>Checkpointing operation</strong>\
Now, your system is set up to use the Checkpoint/Restart features of
MVAPICH2. Several parameters are provided by MVAPICH2 for flexibility in
configuration and using the Checkpoint / Restart features. If mpiexec is
used as the job start up mechanism, these parameters need to be set in
the user's environment through the BASH shell's <code>export</code> command, or the
equivalent command for other shells. If mpirun_rsh is used as the job
start up mechanism, these parameters need to be passed to mpirun_rsh
through the command line.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>MV2_CKPT_FILE: This parameter specifies the path and the base file
    name for checkpoint files of MPI processes. Please note that File
    System performance is critical to the performance of checkpointing.
    This parameter controls which file system will be used to store the
    checkpoint files. For example, if your PVFS2 is mounted at\
    <code>/mnt/pvfs2</code>, using <code>MV2_CKPT_FILE=/mnt/pvfs2/ckptfile</code> will let
    the checkpoint files being stored in pvfs2 file system. See
    Section <a href="/parameters/#mv2_ckpt_file">mv2-ckpt-file</a> for details.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>MV2_CKPT_INTERVAL: This parameter (in minutes) can be used to enable
    automatic checkpointing. See
    Section <a href="/parameters/#mv2_ckpt_interval">mv2-ckpt-interval</a> for details.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>MV2_CKPT_MAX_SAVE_CKPTS: This parameter is used to limit the number
    of checkpoints saved on file system. See
    Section <a href="/parameters/#mv2_ckpt_max_save_ckpts">mv2-max-save-ckpts</a> for details.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>MV2_CKPT_NO_SYNC: This parameter is used to control whether the
    program forces the checkpoint files being synced to disk or not
    before it continues execution. See
    Section <a href="/parameters/#mv2_ckpt_no_sync">mv2-ckpt-no-sync</a> for details.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In order to provide maximum flexibility to end users who wish to use the
checkpoint/restart features of MVAPICH2, we have provided three
different methods that can be used to take checkpoints during the
execution of the MPI application. These methods are described as
follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Manual Checkpointing: In this mode, the user simply launches an MPI
    application and chooses when to checkpoint the application. This
    mode can be primarily used for experimentation during deployment
    stages. In order to use this mode, the MPI application is launched
    normally using <code>mpiexec</code> or <code>mpirun_rsh</code>. When the user decides to
    take a checkpoint, the users can issue a BLCR command namely
    "<code>cr_checkpoint</code>" in the following manner:</p>
<pre><code> cr_checkpoint -p &lt;PID&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>where PID is the process id of the <code>mpiexec</code> or <code>mpirun_rsh</code>
process. In order to simplify the process, the script
<code>mv2_checkpoint</code> can be used. This script is available in the same
directory as <code>mpiexec</code> and <code>mpirun_rsh</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Automated Checkpointing: In this mode, the user can launch the MPI
    application normally using <code>mpiexec</code> or <code>mpirun_rsh</code>. However,
    instead of manually issuing checkpoints as described in the above
    bullet, a parameter (<code>MV2_CKPT_INTERVAL</code>) can be set to
    automatically take checkpoints and user-defined intervals. Please
    refer to
    Section <a href="/parameters/#mv2_ckpt_interval">mv2-ckpt-interval</a> for a complete usage description
    of this variable. This mode can be used to take checkpoints of a
    long running application, for example every 1 hour, 2 hours etc.
    based on user's choice.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Application Initiated Synchronous Checkpointing: In this mode, the
    MPI application which is running can itself request for a
    checkpoint. Application can request a whole program checkpoint
    synchronously by calling <code>MVAPICH2_Sync_Checkpoint</code>. Note that it is
    a collective operation, and this function must be called from all
    processes to take the checkpoint. This mode is expected to be used
    by applications that can be modified and have well defined
    synchronization points. These points can be effectively used to take
    checkpoints. An example of how this mode can be activated is given
    below.</p>
<pre><code>    #include "mpi.h"
    #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;
    #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

    int main(int argc,char *argv[])
    {
        MPI_Init(&amp;argc,&amp;argv);
        printf("Computation\n");
        sleep(5);
        MPI_Barrier(MPI_COMM_WORLD);
        MVAPICH2_Sync_Checkpoint();
        MPI_Barrier(MPI_COMM_WORLD);
        printf("Computation\n");
        sleep(5);
        MPI_Finalize();
        return 0;
    }
</code></pre>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Restart operation</strong></p>
<p>To restart a job from a <strong>manual checkpoint</strong>, users need to issue
another command of BLCR, "<code>cr_restart</code>" with the checkpoint file name of
the MPI job console as the parameter. Usually, this file is named\
<code>context.&lt;pid&gt;</code>. The checkpoint file name of the MPI job console can be
specified when issuing the checkpoint (see the "<code>cr_checkpoint –help</code>"
for more information). Please note that the names of checkpoint files of
the MPI processes will be assigned according to the environment variable
MV2_CKPT_FILE,\
(<code>$MV2_CKPT_FILE.&lt;number of checkpoint&gt;.&lt;process rank&gt;</code>).</p>
<p>To restart a job from an <strong>automatic checkpoint</strong>, use
<code>cr_restart $MV2_CKPT_FILE.&lt;number of checkpoint&gt;.auto</code>.</p>
<p>If the user wishes to restart the MPI job on a different set of nodes,
the host file that was specified along with the "<code>-hostfile</code>\" option
during job launch phase should be modified accordingly before trying to
restart a job with "<code>cr_restart</code>". This modified "<code>hostfile</code>\" must be
at the same location and with the same file name as the original
hostfile. The mpirun_rsh framework parses the host file again when
trying to restart from a checkpoint, and launches the job on the
corresponding nodes. This is possible as long as the nodes in which the
user is trying to restart has the exact same environment as the one in
which the checkpoint was taken (including shared NFS mounts, kernel
versions, and user libraries).</p>
<p>For this to function correctly, the user should disable pre-linking on
both the source and the destination node. See the  <a href="https://upc-bugs.lbl.gov//blcr/doc/html/FAQ.html#prelink">FAQ
Section</a> of
the BLCR userguide for more information.</p>
<p>Please refer to the
Section <a href="/troubleshooting/#checkpointrestart">troubleshooting-ckpt</a> for troubleshooting with
Checkpoint/Restart.</p>
<h4 id="write-aggregation-based-fast-checkpointing-scheme">Write-Aggregation based Fast Checkpointing Scheme:</h4>
<p>MVAPICH2 provides an enhanced technique that allows fast checkpoint and
restart. This scheme, named Aggregation, relies on the Filesystem in
Userspace (FUSE) library.</p>
<p>Although Aggregation is optional, its usage is recommended to achieve
best performances during checkpoint and restart operations. That is why,
if the FUSE library is detected during configuration step, it will be
automatically enabled (see
section <a href="/install/#configuring-a-build-for-ofa-ib-ch3ofa-iwarp-ch3ofa-roce-ch3">config-gen2</a>). Once enabled at configuration step,
aggregation scheme can be disabled at run time by setting the
environment variable <code>MV2_CKPT_USE_AGGREGATION=0</code> (see
section <a href="/parameters/#mv2_ckpt_use_aggregation">mv2-ckpt-use-aggregation</a> for details).</p>
<p>The following steps need to be done to use FUSE library for aggregation
scheme.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Download and install the Filesystem in Userspace (FUSE) library
    package. The packages can be downloaded from <a href="http://fuse.sourceforge.net/">this web
    page</a>. To get the best performance,
    users are encouraged to upgrade to kernel version $\geq 2.6.26$ and
    use FUSE library $\geq 2.8$.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make sure the FUSE packages are installed on every node and the
    <code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code> must contain the path to the shared library of
    FUSE, usually <code>$FUSE_HOME/lib</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>MVAPICH2 needs to be compiled with checkpoint/restart support, see
    section <a href="/install/#configuring-a-build-for-ofa-ib-ch3ofa-iwarp-ch3ofa-roce-ch3">config-gen2</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>FUSE kernel modules must be loaded on all the compute nodes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make sure the PATH contains the path to the executables of FUSE,
    usually <code>$FUSE_HOME/bin</code>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If write aggregation has been enabled at configuration time, MVAPICH2
will check the FUSE configuration of each node during startup (FUSE
module loaded and <code>fusermount</code> command in the PATH). If one node is not
properly configured, then MVAPICH2 will abort. In this case, you need to
fix the FUSE configuration of the nodes, or disable aggregation using
<code>MV2_CKPT_USE_AGGREGATION=0</code> to run MVAPICH2.</p>
<h4 id="fault-tolerance-backplane-ftb-support">Fault Tolerance Backplane (FTB) support:</h4>
<p>MVAPICH2 supports the new standardized Fault Tolerance Backplane (FTB).
FTB can be used for Checkpoint-Restart and Job Pause-Migration-Restart
Frameworks. Activating FTB support is optional to perform
checkpoint/restart operations, but it will allow MVAPICH2 to
automatically publish and listen to standardized events through the
Fault Tolerance Backplane.</p>
<p>FTB has been developed and standardized by the <a href="http://www.mcs.anl.gov/research/cifts/">CIFTS
project</a>. It enables faults to
be handled in a coordinated and holistic manner in the entire system,
providing for an infrastructure which can be used by different software
systems to exchange fault-related information.</p>
<p>If using the FTB framework for checkpoint/restart, the following steps
need to be done in addition to the above nodes.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Download and install the FTB (Fault Tolerance Backplane) package.
    The packages can be downloaded from
    <a href="https://github.com/codes-org/codes/releases">here</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make sure the FTB packages are installed on every node and the
    <code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code> must contain the path to the shared library of
    FTB, usually <code>$FTB_HOME/lib</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>MVAPICH2 needs to be compiled with checkpoint/restart as well as FTB
    support, see
    section <a href="/install/#configuring-a-build-for-ofa-ib-ch3ofa-iwarp-ch3ofa-roce-ch3">config-gen2</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Start FTB Database server (<code>$FTB_HOME/sbin/ftb_database_server</code>) on
    one of the nodes, this node will act as server node for all the FTB
    agents.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Start FTB agents (<code>$FTB_HOME/sbin/ftb_agent</code>) on all the compute
    nodes.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="checkpointrestart-support-for-the-ofa-ib-nemesis-interface">Checkpoint/Restart support for the OFA-IB-Nemesis Interface:</h4>
<p>MVAPICH2 also provides Checkpoint-Restart capabilities for the
OFA-IB-Nemesis interface. Currently, this feature can only be used in
conjunction with the Hydra process manager. More details on using Hydra
to checkpoint an MPI application can be
found <a href="http://wiki.mcs.anl.gov/mpich2/index.php/Using_the_Hydra_Process_Manager#Checkpoint.2FRestart_Support">here</a>.</p>
<h3 id="multi-level-checkpointing-with-scalable-checkpoint-restart-scr">Multi-Level Checkpointing with Scalable Checkpoint-Restart (SCR)</h3>
<p>The  <a href="https://computing.llnl.gov/projects/scalable-checkpoint-restart-for-mpi">Scalable
Checkpoint-Restart</a> (SCR)
library developed at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL)
enables MPI applications to utilize distributed storage on Linux
clusters to attain high file I/O bandwidth for checkpointing and
restarting large-scale jobs. With SCR, jobs run more efficiently, lose
less work upon a failure, and reduce load on critical shared resources
such as the parallel file system and the network infrastructure.</p>
<p>In the current SCR implementation, application checkpoint files are
cached in storage local to the compute nodes, and a redundancy scheme is
applied such that the cached files can be recovered even after a failure
disables part of the system. SCR supports the use of spare nodes such
that it is possible to restart a job directly from its cached
checkpoint, provided the redundancy scheme holds and provided there are
sufficient spares.</p>
<p>The SCR library implements three redundancy schemes which trade of
performance, storage space, and reliability:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Local</strong>: Each checkpoint file is written to storage on the local
    node</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Partner</strong>: Each checkpoint file is written to storage on the local
    node, and a full copy of each file is written to storage on a
    partner node</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>XOR</strong>: Each checkpoint file is written to storage on the local
    node, XOR parity data are computed using checkpoint files from a set
    of nodes, and the parity data are stored among the set</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>SCR is integrated into MVAPICH2 to provide Multi-Level checkpointing
capabilities to MPI applications in two modes: application-aware mode
and transparent mode. The following sub-sections illustrate the steps
needed to checkpoint an application using these two schemes.</p>
<h4 id="application-aware-multi-level-checkpointing">Application-Aware Multi-Level Checkpointing:</h4>
<p>In this case, it is assumed that the application knows what data to
checkpoint and how to read data from a checkpoint during a restart. It
is also assumed that each process writes its checkpoint data in a unique
file. For an application to actually write a checkpoint using SCR, the
following steps need to be followed.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The application must call <code>SCR_Start_checkpoint</code> to define the start
    boundary of a new checkpoint. It must do this before it opens any
    file it writes as part of the checkpoint.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The application must call <code>SCR_Route_file</code> for each file it writes
    as part of the checkpoint to register each file and to determine the
    full path and file name to use to open each file.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After the application has registered, written, and closed each of
    its files for the checkpoint, it must call <code>SCR_Complete_checkpoint</code>
    to define the end boundary of the checkpoint. If a process does not
    write any files during a checkpoint, it must still call
    <code>SCR_Start_checkpoint</code> and\
    <code>SCR_Complete_checkpoint</code> as these functions are collective. All
    files registered through a call to <code>SCR_Route_file</code> between a given
    <code>SCR_Start_checkpoint</code> and <code>SCR_Complete_checkpoint</code> pair are
    considered to be part of the same checkpoint file set.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The initialization and finalization of SCR (<code>SCR_Init</code> and
    <code>SCR_Finalize</code> functions) will be implicitly handled by MVAPICH2.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The following code snippet describes the checkpointing function of a
sample MPI application that writes checkpoints using SCR:</p>
<pre><code>/* Determine whether we need to checkpoint */
int flag;
SCR_Need_checkpoint(&amp;flag);
if (flag) {
    /* Tell SCR that a new checkpoint is starting */
    SCR_Start_checkpoint();

    /* Define the checkpoint file name for this process */
    int rank;
    char name[256];
    MPI_Comm_rank(MPI_COMM_WORLD, &amp;rank );
    sprintf (name, "rank_%d.ckpt", rank);

    /* Register our file, and get the full path to open it */
    char file[SCR MAX FILENAME];
    SCR_Route_file name , file);

    /* Open, write, and close the file */
    int valid = 0;
    FILE *fs = open( file, "w") ;
    if ( fs != NULL ) {
        valid = 1;
        size_t n = fwrite(checkpoint_data, 1, sizeof(checkpoint_data), fs);
        if (n != sizeof(checkpoint data)) {
            valid = 0;
        }
        if ( fclose(fs) != 0 ) {
            valid = 0;
        }
    }

    /* Tell SCR that this process is done writing its checkpoint files */
    SCR_Complete_checkpoint( valid ) ;
}
</code></pre>
<p>The following code snippet describes the SCR-assisted restart mechanism
for a sample MPI application:</p>
<pre><code>/* Define the checkpoint filename for this process */
int rank;
char name[256];
MPI_Comm_rank(MPI_COMM_WORLD, &amp;rank);
sprintf( name, "rank_%d.ckpt", rank);
/* Get the full path to open our file */
char file[SCR_MAX_FILENAME];
if (SCR_Route_file( name, file) == SCR SUCCESS) {
    /* Open, read, and close the file */
    FILE *fs = open( file, "r");
    size_t n = fread(checkpoint_data, 1, sizeof(checkpoint_data), fs);
    fclose(fs);
} else {
    /* There is no existing file to restart from */
}
</code></pre>

<h4 id="transparent-multi-level-checkpointing">Transparent Multi-Level Checkpointing</h4>
<p>:</p>
<p>The benefits of SCR can also be leveraged by applications that do not
employ their own Checkpoint-Restart mechanism. The SCR-MVAPICH2
integration makes this possible by using SCR to manage the checkpoints
generated by BLCR the basic system-level Checkpointing scheme described
in Section <a href="/install/#configuring-a-build-for-ofa-ib-ch3ofa-iwarp-ch3ofa-roce-ch3">2.15.1.1</a>. Once MVAPICH2 has been configured with
SCR, the steps required to checkpoint and restart a job transparently
using BLCR and SCR are the same as what is described in
Section <a href="/install/#configuring-a-build-for-ofa-ib-ch3ofa-iwarp-ch3ofa-roce-ch3">2.15.1.1</a>. MVAPICH2 uses SCR's APIs internally to
transparently manage checkpoint storage efficiently.</p>

<h3 id="job-pause-migration-restart-support">Job Pause-Migration-Restart Support</h3>
<p>MVAPICH2 provides a node-level Job Pause-Migration-Restart mechanism for
the OFA-IB-CH3 interface, which can be used to migrate MPI processes on
a given failing node to a healthy node, selected from a pool of spare
hosts provided by the user during job-launch.</p>
<p>This Job Migration framework relies on BLCR and FTB libraries. See
subsections in  <a href="/install/#configuring-a-build-for-ofa-ib-ch3ofa-iwarp-ch3ofa-roce-ch3">2.15.1</a> to set up these libraries. The source and
target nodes are required to have these libraries installed in the same
path.</p>
<p>The Job Migration framework makes use of BLCR to take a checkpoint of
all MPI processes running on the failing node in question. Users are
strongly recommended to either disable "prelinking\" feature, or execute
the following command:\
\
on all nodes before starting a job that will later be migrated. Please
refer to this BLCR web page for complete information:  <a href="https://upc-bugs.lbl.gov//blcr/doc/html/FAQ.html#prelink">BLCR
FAQ.</a></p>
<p>During job-launch, the list of spare hosts can be provided as input to
mpirun_rsh using the <code>-sparehosts</code> option which takes a hostfile as
argument.</p>
<p>The following example illustrates a sample MPI job being launched to run
with job migration support:\
\
where <code>spare_hosts</code> is a file which contains a list of healthy spare
hosts that is needed by the job migration framework.</p>
<p>An actual migration of MPI processes from a failing source node to a
target spare node can be triggered using one of two methods - using
signals or using the <code>mv2_trigger</code> utility.</p>
<p>For the signal-triggered method, users can manually initiate the
migration protocol by issuing a <code>SIGUSR2</code> signal to the <code>mpispawn</code>
processes running on the source node. This can be done using the
following command:\
\
The migration protocol can also be triggered using the simple utility
provided with MVAPICH2:\
\
where <code>src</code> is the hostname of the health-deteriorating node from which
all MPI processes need to be migrated.</p>
<p>Please note, that the <code>ftb_agent</code> daemon will have to be launched on all
the compute nodes and the spare nodes before launching the MPI
application, in order to successfully migrate MPI processes. See section
 <a href="/install/#configuring-a-build-for-ofa-ib-ch3ofa-iwarp-ch3ofa-roce-ch3">2.15.1.3</a> for information about setting up the FTB
infrastructure.</p>
<h3 id="run-through-stabilization">Run-Through Stabilization</h3>
<p>MVAPICH2 provides support for run-through stabilization wherein
communication failures are not treated as fatal errors. On enabling this
capability, MVAPICH2 returns the appropriate error code to a user-set
error handler in the event of a communication failure, instead of
terminating the entire job. When a process detects a failure when
communicating with another process, it will consider the other process
as having failed and will no longer attempt to communicate with that
process. The user can, however, continue making communication calls to
other processes. Any outstanding send or receive operations to a failed
process, or wild-card receives (i.e., with MPI_ANY_SOURCE) posted to
communicators with a failed process, will be immediately completed with
an appropriate error code.</p>
<p>Currently, this support is available only for the OFA-IB-Nemesis and
TCP/IP-Nemesis interfaces, when the Hydra process manager is used.</p>
<p>It can be enabled at run-time by:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Setting the environment variable <code>MV2_RUN_THROUGH_STABILIZATION=1</code>
    (see
    section <a href="/parameters-nem/#mv2_run_through_stabilization">nem-run-through-stab</a>), and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>passing the <code>--disable-auto-cleanup</code> flag to Hydra launcher.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="network-fault-tolerance-with-automatic-path-migration">Network Fault Tolerance with Automatic Path Migration</h3>
<p>MVAPICH2 supports network fault recovery by using InfiniBand Automatic
Path Migration (APM) mechanism for OFA-IB-CH3 interface. This support is
available for MPI applications using OpenFabrics stack and InfiniBand
adapters.</p>
<p>To enable this functionality, a run-time variable, MV2_USE_APM
(Section <a href="/parameters/#mv2_use_apm">mv2-use-apm</a>) can be enabled, as shown in the following
example:\
\
or\
\
MVAPICH2 also supports testing Automatic Path Migration in the subnet in
the absence of network faults. This can be controlled by using a
run-time variable MV2_USE_APM_TEST
(Section <a href="/parameters/#mv2_use_apm_test">mv2-use-apm-test</a>). This should be combined with
MV2_USE_APM as follows:\

<h2 id="running-with-rdma-cm-support">Running with RDMA CM support</h2>
<p>In MVAPICH2, for using RDMA CM the run time variable <code>MV2_USE_RDMA_CM</code>
needs to be used as described in
<a href="/parameters/">mvapich-parameters</a>. This applies to OFA-IB-CH3,
OFA-iWARP-CH3 and OFA-RoCE-CH3 interfaces.</p>
<p>In addition to these flags, all the systems to be used need the
following one time setup for enabling RDMA CM usage.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Setup the RDMA CM interface:</strong> RDMA CM interface needs to be
    setup, configured with an IP address and connected to the network.\</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Setup the Local Address File:</strong> Create mv2.conf file in a standard
    location (<code>/etc/mv2.conf</code>) or user defined path specified using

    ( <a href="/parameters/#mv2_rdma_cm_conf_file_path">mv2-rdma-cm-conf-file-path</a> ) with the local IP
    address to be used by RDMA CM. (Multiple IP addresses can be listed

<h2 id="compiler-specific-flags-to-enable-openmp-thread-binding">Compiler Specific Flags to enable OpenMP thread binding</h2>
<p>Further, to get better performance for applications that use MPI +
OpenMP, we recommend binding the OpenMP threads to the processor cores.
This can potentially avoid cache effects due to unwanted thread
migration. For example, if we consider a Quad-Core processor, with 1 MPI
process and 4 OpenMP threads, we recommend binding OpenMP thread 0 to
core 0, OpenMP thread 1 to core 1 and so on. This can be achieved by
setting the kernel affinity via the following compiler-specific
environment variables:</p>
<p><strong>Intel Compilers:</strong> On Intel processors, we recommend using the
KMP_AFFINITY run-time flag in the following manner:</p>

<p>MV2_CPU_BINDING_POLICY is used to bind MPI ranks to processor cores. We
have also introduced a new variable called MV2_HYBRID_BINDING_POLICY
that offers several new policies for hybrid and thread specific binding
in MPI and MPI+Threads execution environments. The possible bindings
offered by this variable are "bunch\", "scatter\", "linear\",
"compact\", "spread\", and "numa\".</p>
<p><strong>linear</strong> --- assigns cores to MPI rank and their corresponding threads
linearly. For example, first rank followed by its threads, followed by
second rank and its corresponding threads and so on.</p>

<p>This will assign ranks and their corresponding threads linearly.</p>
<p><strong>compact</strong> --- assigns all MPI ranks to physical cores first, and then
starts assigning logical cores or hardware threads to each rank's
threads in linear fashion. This policy should only be used when the
hyper-/hardware-multithreading is enabled and the user intends to map
application threads to hardware threads.</p>
<p>Example with 8 MPI processes and 4 OpenMP threads per process on a
68-core KNL processor with "compact\" binding policy for threads is
shown below:</p>
<p>\</p>
<pre><code>-------------CPU AFFINITY-------------
RANK: 0  CPU_SET:    0  68 136 204
RANK: 1  CPU_SET:    1  69 137 205
RANK: 2  CPU_SET:    2  70 138 206

--------------------------------------
</code></pre>
<p>This will assign one physical core per MPI rank. Since there are four
hardware-threads per physical core in KNL, the four OpenMP threads of
each rank will be mapped to the hardware threads of the corresponding
core. The CPU binding will be set as shown in
Figure <a href="#fig:compact1">8</a>{reference-type="ref"

MV2_THREADS_PER_PROCESS must be a positive integer.</p>
<p><strong>spread</strong> --- This policy ensures that no two MPI ranks get bound to
the same physical core. Moreover, this policy will equally distribute
the resources (physical cores and hw/threads) among the MPI processes.
It also ensures correct bindings on some clusters that have non-trivial
vendor specific mappings.</p>

<p>This will assign one MPI rank per physical core avoiding resource
contention caused by multiple MPI ranks getting bound to logical cores.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong> --- The correct use of this environment variable mandates that\
MV2_CPU_BINDING_POLICY should be set to "hybrid\" and
MV2_THREADS_PER_PROCESS must be a positive integer.</p>
<p><strong>numa</strong> --- This policy allows for MPI ranks to get bound to different
numa domains in a round-robin manner. For example, the first process
will be bound to the first physical core of the first numa domain, the
second process on to the first physical core of the second numa domain,
and so on. It also ensures correct bindings on some clusters that have
non-trivial vendor specific mappings.</p>
<p>Example with 16 MPI processes on an AMD EPYC 7551 processor with 8 numa
domains with is shown below:</p>

<p>Each MPI rank is assigned to a different NUMA domain in a round-robin
manner. The CPU binding will be set as shown in

MV2_CPU_BINDING_POLICY should be set to "hybrid\" and
MV2_THREADS_PER_PROCESS must be a positive integer (already set by
default). Furthermore, this policy is default on AMD EPYC systems when
more than two processes are used.</p>
<p><strong>bunch</strong> --- assigns cores to MPI ranks in the same way as "bunch\"
option described earlier. It additionally takes care of the vendor
specific non-trivial core mappings. Further, it also ensures that the
MPI ranks are bound to the physical cores only.</p>
<p><strong>scatter</strong> --- similar to "bunch\", this also assigns cores to MPI
ranks in "scatter\" option given to MV2_CPU_BINDING_POLICY. It
additionally takes care of vendor specific non-trivial core mappings. It
also ensures that the MPI ranks are only bound to the physical cores
only.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong> --- "bunch\" and "scatter\" options for
MV2_HYBRID_BINDING_POLICY are recommended to be used as a solution to
vendor specific non-trivial mapping issues. These should be considered
an alternate to "bunch\" or "scatter\" given to CPU_BINDING_POLICY.</p>
<h2 id="running-with-hot-spot-and-congestion-avoidance">Running with Hot-Spot and Congestion Avoidance</h2>
<p>MVAPICH2 supports hot-spot and congestion avoidance using InfiniBand
multi-pathing mechanism. This support is available for MPI applications
using OFA-IB-CH3 interface.</p>
<p>To enable this functionality, a run-time variable, MV2_USE_HSAM
(Section <a href="/parameters/#mv2_use_hsam">mv2-use-hsam</a>) can be enabled, as shown in the following
example:\
\
or\
\
This functionality automatically defines the number of paths for
hot-spot avoidance. Alternatively, the maximum number of paths to be
used between a pair of processes can be defined by using a run-time
variable MV2_NUM_QP_PER_PORT
(Section <a href="/parameters/#mv2_num_qp_per_port">num-qp-per-port</a>).</p>
<p>We expect this functionality to show benefits in the presence of at
least partially non-overlapping paths in the network. OpenSM, the subnet
manager distributed with OpenFabrics supports LMC mechanism, which can
be used to create multiple paths:</p>
<p>\
will start the subnet manager with LMC value to four, creating sixteen
paths between every pair of nodes.</p>
<h2 id="running-on-clusters-with-nvidia-gpu-accelerators">Running on Clusters with NVIDIA GPU Accelerators</h2>
<p>MVAPICH2 CH3-based interface supports MPI communication using NVIDIA GPU
device memory with CUDA versions 4.0 or later. This feature removes the
need for the application developer to explicitly move the data from
device memory to host memory before using MPI for communication. The new
support allows direct MPI communication from device memory to device
memory, device memory to host memory and host memory to device memory.
It also supports point-to-point and collective communication using
contiguous and non-contiguous MPI datatypes. It takes advantage of CUDA
IPC for intra-node GPU-GPU communication (with CUDA 4.1).\
\
For example, without CUDA support in the MPI library, a typical user
might be using the following sequence of commands to move data from a
device memory to another device memory.\
\
<em>...\
cudaMemcpy(host_buf, device_buf, size, cudaMemcpyDeviceToDevice);\
MPI_Isend(host_buf, size, MPI_CHAR, 1, 100, MPI_COMM_WORLD, req);\
...\
</em>\
With the support provided in MVAPICH2 and support of CUDA 4.0 (and
later), the user can achieve the same data movement operation by
explicitly specifying MPI calls on device memory.\
*...\
MPI_Isend(device_buf, size, MPI_CHAR, 1, 100, MPI_COMM_WORLD, req);\
...\
*</p>
<p>This support can be enabled by configuring MVAPICH2 with <code>–enable-cuda</code>
and setting the environment variable MV2_USE_CUDA
( <a href="/parameters/#mv2_use_cuda">use-cuda</a>) to 1 during runtime.</p>
<p>To minimize communication overhead, MVAPICH2 divides copies between
device and host into chunks. This can be better tuned for internode
transfers with a runtime environment variable MV2_CUDA_BLOCK_SIZE
( <a href="/parameters/#mv2_cuda_block_size">cuda-block-size</a>). The default chunk size is 64K
(65536). However, higher values of this parameter, such as 256K (262144)
and 512K (524288), might deliver better performance if the MPI
application uses large messages. The optimal value for this parameter
depends on several other factors such as InfiniBand network/adapter
speed, GPU adapter characteristics, platform characteristics (processor
and memory speed) and amount of memory to be dedicated to the MPI
library with GPU support. For different platforms and MPI applications,
the users are encouraged to try out different values for this parameter
to get best performance.</p>
<p>MVAPICH2 takes advantage of tunable two-dimensional CUDA kernel for
packing/unpacking data when MPI vector datatype is used in communication
involving GPU memory. The CUDA thread block size and dimensions are
automatically tuned based on the dimensions of the vector. Users can
also control the number of CUDA threads per block using the runtime
parameter: MV2_CUDA_KERNEL_VECTOR_TIDBLK_SIZE (default value is 1024)
( <a href="/parameters/#mv2_cuda_kernel_vector_tidblk_size">cuda-kernel-vector-threadblock</a>). They can adjust the
number of threads operating on each data block of the vector using\
MV2_CUDA_KERNEL_VECTOR_YSIZE (tuned based on vector size)
( <a href="/parameters/#mv2_cuda_kernel_vector_ysize">cuda-kernel-vector-ysize</a>).</p>
<h4 id="gpu-affinity">GPU Affinity:</h4>
<p>When multiple GPUs are present on a node, users might want to set the
MPI process affinity to a particular GPU using cuda calls like
cudaSetDevice(). This can be done after MPI_Init based on MPI rank of
the process or before MPI_Init using the local rank of a process
obtained from an environment variable MV2_COMM_WORLD_LOCAL_RANK.</p>
<h2 id="mpirun_rsh-compatibility-with-mpiexec">MPIRUN_RSH compatibility with MPIEXEC</h2>
<p>There is now a front end to mpirun_rsh that aims for compatibility with
mpiexec usage as recommended by the MPI standard. This front end is can
be used by calling mpiexec.mpirun_rsh.</p>
<p>The main differences between this and mpirun_rsh is that this front end
doesn't require you to specify hosts or environment variables on the
command line. Also, the host file options is -f as opposed to -hostfile.</p>
<p>Run 4 instances of CPI on localhost:</p>
<p>Run 4 instances of CPI on the nodes specified by hostfile:</p>
<h3 id="interaction-with-slurm">Interaction with SLURM</h3>
<p>If the hostfile isn't given and mpiexec.mpirun_rsh finds the appropriate
slurm environment variables set, mpiexec will use these to determine
which nodes the applications should be launched on.</p>
<p>Please note that processes are assigned in a block fashion by slurm so
all the processes will run on the same node if possible.</p>

<h2 id="running-with-intel-trace-analyzer-and-collector">Running with Intel Trace Analyzer and Collector</h2>
<p>MVAPICH2 supports compiling and running MPI applications with Intel
Trace Analyzer and Collector (ITAC), so that the MPI calls in an
execution can be traced, and the logs can be used for functionality or
performance analysis. The following steps need to be done to make an MPI
application work with ITAC.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Export the environment variables of ITAC. You can either export the
    entire set of ITAC variables for your architecture by script:</p>
<p>or simply export the only variable of VTune root that needed by
MVAPICH2:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Compile your application using <code>mpicc</code>, <code>mpifort</code> or other compiling
    commands with the "<code>-itac</code>" option. For example:</p>
<p>If configure/Makefile or other building scripts are employed, you
should append "<code>-itac</code>" to the compiling and linking options such as
"<code>CFLAGS</code>". For example:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Run the created binary with an MPI launcher in the normal way. After
    execution, the ITAC prompt information will be printed on stderr,
    and some trace files will be created in current directory.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Launch the GUI tool of ITAC on a desktop environment or through X11
    forwarding from the server, load the trace file with the "<code>.stf</code>"
    suffix, and the MPI calls within that execution can be visualized
    and analyzed.</p>

<h2 id="running-with-mcdram-support-on-intel-knights-landing-knl-processor">Running with MCDRAM support on Intel Knights Landing (KNL) processor</h2>
<p>This section describes the procedure to take advantage of the High
Bandwidth Memory (MCDRAM) available with the Intel Knights Landing
processor. The method discussed here is basic and does not require
modifications to the user application or MPI library.</p>
<p><strong>Allocating Memory on MCDRAM</strong></p>
<p>In order to do all the memory allocations including application buffers
and/or internal buffers of MVAPICH2, one can use the <em>numactl</em> system
call. This is beneficial when KNL is configured in Flat/Hybrid mode
where MCDRAM can be viewed as separate NUMA node.</p>
<p><em>Step 1</em>: Verify that KNL is configured in Flat/Hybrid mode. One can
execute the <em>numactl -H</em> command to verify this. A sample output is also
given below. As can be seen from the sample output, when KNL is in
Flat-mode NUMA node 0 consists of all the processor cores and DDR memory
( approximately 96GB in size). NUMA node 1 consists of only the MCDRAM
(approximately 16GB in size).</p>

</code></pre>
<p><em>Step 2</em>: Executing applications to take advantage of MCDRAM.</p>
<p>All memory allocations made by the application as well as MVAPICH2 can
be redirected to MCDRAM by prepending <em>numactl --membind
$&lt;$MCDRAM_numa_node$&gt;$</em> to the job invocation. An example of the same is
given below.</p>
<p>\
<strong>Viewing MCDRAM Allocations</strong></p>
<p>To verify that the allocations are indeed being done on the MCDRAM, the
<em>numastat -p $&lt;$pid$&gt;$</em> command can be used where "pid" refers to the
process ID of one of the application processes. An example of the same
is given below.</p>
<p>Note that the pages are not allocated until the memory is actually
"touched" by the application and/or the MVAPICH2 MPI library. Thus,
'<code>numastat</code>' will only report a difference in the amount of memory after
the memory is touched.</p>

<h2 id="running-collectives-with-hardware-based-sharp-support">Running Collectives with Hardware based SHArP support</h2>
<p>In MVAPICH2, support for SHArP-based collectives has been enabled for
MPI applications running over OFA-IB-CH3 interface. Currently, this
support is available for the following collective operations:</p>
<ul>
<li>MPI_Allreduce</li>
</ul>
<p>This feature is disabled by default at configuration time. To use this
feature, you need to use <code>–enable-sharp</code> configuration option and
specify the path to SHArP installation location by adding the paths to
LDFLAGS and CFLAGS. Also, <code>-lsharp</code> and <code>-lsharp_coll</code> flags must be
added to LDFLAGS. See the example below.</p>
<pre><code>./configure --enable-sharp LDFLAGS="-Wl,-rpath,/opt/hpcx/1.8/sharp/lib
-L/opt/hpcx/1.8/sharp/lib -lsharp -lsharp_coll" 
CFLAGS="-I/opt/hpcx/1.8/sharp/include/sharp"
</code></pre>
<p>Please note that SHArP library is a part of HPCX Software Toolkit and
the network must be equipped with Mellanox Switch-IB2. Currently,
MVAPICH2 supports SHArP library of HPCX v1.7 and v1.8.</p>
<p>Note that the various SHArP related daemons (SHArP Aggregation Manager -
<em>sharpam</em> and the local SHArP daemon - <em>sharpd</em> must be installed, setup
and running for SHArP support in MVAPICH2 to work properly. This can be
verified by running the <code>sharp_hello</code> program available in the "bin"
sub-folder of the SHArP installation directory.</p>
<p>This feature is turned off by default at runtime and can be turned on at
runtime by using parameter MV2_ENABLE_SHARP=1
( <a href="/parameters/#mv2_enable_sharp">enable-sharp</a>). Collective tuning has been done to
ensure the best performance.</p>
<p>When using HPCX v1.7, we recommend setting
SHARP_COLL_ENABLE_GROUP_TRIM=0 environment variable. Note that if you
are using <code>mpirun_rsh</code> you need to add <code>-export</code> option to make sure
that environment variable is exported correctly. This environment
variable is a part of SHArP library. Please refer to SHArP
